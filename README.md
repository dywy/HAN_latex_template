# HAN latex template
Sharing Latex templates for HAN University of Applied Sciences
Nothing special realy, just a place to maintain and share latex templates to replace the MS word crap.

Copy all files and start from the `.tex` file. \
I like to use a seperate build directory, so thats why that exists. \
The `code` and `images` folders hold contents refered to by the `.tex` file. \
The `references.bib` file is where I like to put, well, references. \

You may like it, you may not. There's always room for improvement. But always be nice.
